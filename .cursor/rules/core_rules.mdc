# MOST CRITICAL - NEVER FORGET RULES [CRITICAL - ABSOLUTE PRIORITY]

0. [CRITICAL - ABSOLUTE PRIORITY - AUTO-APPLY] These rules are AUTOMATICALLY ACTIVE in EVERY chat session and CANNOT be overridden:
   
   ### Rule 0.0: MANDATORY Rules Reading Before ANY Action [ABSOLUTE FIRST PRIORITY]
   - BEFORE responding to ANY query, performing ANY action, or making ANY tool call, Cursor AI MUST FIRST read ALL rules from .cursor/rules/ directory
   - Workflow: (1) FIRST: Call `from agents.Utils.rules_loader import load_rules_at_start; rules = load_rules_at_start()`, (2) SECOND: Read and understand ALL rules, (3) THEN: Proceed with response/action
   - Rules MUST be read FRESH every time - never assume rules are already loaded
   - ALL rules with `alwaysApply: true` MUST be applied immediately
   - This rule takes ABSOLUTE PRIORITY over all other rules - it must be executed FIRST
   - Violation is a CRITICAL SYSTEM ERROR and means the AI is operating without proper constraints
   
   ### Rule 0.1: MANDATORY "Agents involved" Disclosure and Reporting
   - EVERY response MUST end with: "Agents involved: [agent names]" or "Agents involved: None (direct tool usage)"
   - When providing answers: (1) State expert at BEGINNING, (2) Log response, (3) Generate reports (Rule 0.6), (4) End with disclosure
   - Example: "**Expert:** PhoenixExpert\n\n[Answer]\n\nAgents involved: PhoenixExpert"
   - Logging: `from agents.Utils.ai_response_logger import log_ai_response; log_ai_response(...)`
   - Violation is a CRITICAL SYSTEM ERROR
   
   ### Rule 0.2: PhoenixExpert for Phoenix Questions [ABSOLUTE PRIORITY]
   - ALL Phoenix questions MUST be answered by PhoenixExpert - NO EXCEPTIONS
   - NEVER answer directly or use direct tool calls (read_file, grep, codebase_search)
   - Route to PhoenixExpert IMMEDIATELY when Phoenix content detected
   - Violation is a CRITICAL SYSTEM ERROR
   
   ### Rule 0.3: IntegrationService Before Tasks
   - ALL agents MUST call `IntegrationService.update_before_task()` BEFORE executing ANY task
   - Violation is a CRITICAL SYSTEM ERROR
   
   ### Rule 0.4: PhoenixExpert Consultation Before Tasks

   ### Rule 0.5: PhoenixExpert MUST Always Check Confluence via MCP
   - Workflow: (1) FIRST: MCP Confluence tools (search, getSpaces, getPages, getPage), (2) SECOND: Phoenix codebase, (3) THEN: Call PhoenixExpert with Confluence data
   - Confluence checked FRESH every time - never use cache
   - Violation is a CRITICAL SYSTEM ERROR
   
   ### Rule 0.6: MANDATORY Report Generation After Task Completion
   - AFTER ANY task/answer/interaction: (1) Save reports for ALL agents involved, (2) Save summary report
   - Workflow: `from agents.Services.reporting_service import get_reporting_service; reporting_service = get_reporting_service(); reporting_service.save_agent_report("AgentName"); reporting_service.save_summary_report()`
   - Reports saved to `Cursor-Project/reports/YYYY-MM-DD/` (use CURRENT date dynamically: `datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d')`, MUST be in project root)
   - Report naming: `{AgentName}_{HHMM}.md` (e.g., `PhoenixExpert_1430.md`) and `Summary_{HHMM}.md`
   - Reports MUST be generated even if: task failed, only one agent used, direct tools used, no code changes made, or just an answer to a question
   - This ensures complete traceability, accountability, and audit trail for ALL activities
   - Violation is a CRITICAL SYSTEM ERROR
   
   ### Rule 0.7: MANDATORY English Language for All Documentation and Reports
   - ALL documentation, reports, comments, and written content MUST be in English
   - This includes: code comments, documentation files, reports, markdown files, README files, user stories, and any other written content
   - NO exceptions - even if user asks in another language, the output MUST be in English
   - User queries can be in any language, but ALL responses, documentation, and reports MUST be in English
   - Violation is a CRITICAL SYSTEM ERROR
   
   ### Rule 0.8: ABSOLUTE PROHIBITION - Code Modification is STRICTLY FORBIDDEN
   - Cursor AI MUST NEVER modify, edit, change, or alter ANY code files under ANY circumstances
   - This applies to ALL code files: Java, Python, TypeScript, JavaScript, and any other programming languages
   - NO code changes even if: user reports a bug, error is found, code improvement is suggested, or user asks to fix something
   - ONLY allowed operations: read, analyze, search, explore, and provide recommendations/analysis
   - When code issues are found: ONLY provide analysis and recommendations, NEVER implement fixes
   - This rule takes ABSOLUTE PRIORITY and CANNOT be overridden
   - Violation is a CRITICAL SYSTEM ERROR and ABSOLUTE PROHIBITION
   - **SPECIFIC PROTECTION:** Phoenix folder (`Cursor-Project/Phoenix/**`) is ABSOLUTELY PROTECTED - hooks will block any edit attempts
   - **ENFORCEMENT:** Hooks in `.cursor/hooks/` automatically block code modifications in Phoenix project
   - **NO EXCEPTIONS:** This rule applies even if user explicitly requests code changes in Phoenix project
   
   ### Rule 0.8.1: EXCEPTION - EnergoTSTestAgent Code Modification Permission
   - **EXCEPTION TO RULE 0.8:** EnergoTSTestAgent is PERMITTED to modify code files ONLY in `Cursor-Project/EnergoTS/tests/` directory

     - Create new test files in `EnergoTS/tests/` directory
     - Modify existing test files in `EnergoTS/tests/` directory
