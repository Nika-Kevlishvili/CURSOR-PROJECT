# WORKFLOW RULES [CRITICAL]

3. [CRITICAL] Every response MUST end with "Agents involved: [agent names]" or "Agents involved: None (direct tool usage)".
   - Ensures transparency, accountability, and traceability.
   - Violation is a CRITICAL ERROR.

# BUG VALIDATION RULE [CRITICAL]

32. [CRITICAL] When analyzing bug reports or bug validation requests, ALWAYS use BugFinderAgent and follow this mandatory workflow:
    
    **MANDATORY: Use BugFinderAgent**
    - ALL bug validation requests MUST be handled by BugFinderAgent
    - Use: `from agents.Main import get_bug_finder_agent; bug_finder = get_bug_finder_agent(); result = bug_finder.validate_bug(bug_description)`
    - BugFinderAgent automatically follows Rule 32 workflow and integrates with all required services
    - This ensures consistent, structured bug validation with proper reporting
    
    **CRITICAL: READ-ONLY MODE - NO CODE MODIFICATIONS**
    - When validating bugs, you MUST work in READ-ONLY mode
    - NEVER modify code during bug validation
    - NEVER attempt to fix bugs during validation
    - ONLY analyze, document, and report findings
    - Code modifications are ONLY allowed if user explicitly requests bug fixing AFTER validation is complete
    - Violation of this rule is a CRITICAL SYSTEM ERROR
    
    **BugFinderAgent Workflow (Rule 32):**
    
    **Step 1: Validate Bug Report Against Confluence**
    - FIRST: Search Confluence using MCP tools (mcp_Confluence_search(), mcp_Confluence_searchConfluenceUsingCql(), mcp_Confluence_getConfluencePage()) for related documentation
    - Check if bug description matches Confluence documentation
    - Verify if bug report contains correct information based on Confluence sources
    - Report findings: "Confluence validation: [correct/incorrect/partially correct] - [explanation]"
    - Document all Confluence sources found (page IDs, titles, URLs)
    
    **Step 2: Validate Code Against Bug Report**
    - SECOND: Search codebase using codebase_search() and grep() to find relevant code
    - Analyze code implementation to verify if it satisfies the bug report requirements
    - Check if code behavior matches expected behavior described in bug report
    - Report findings: "Code validation: [satisfies/does not satisfy] the bug report - [explanation]"
    - Include specific file paths, line numbers, and code snippets
    - Identify exact location of bug in code
    
    **Step 3: Provide Comprehensive Analysis**
    - Combine Confluence findings and code analysis
    - Provide clear answer about:
      1. Whether bug report information is correct based on Confluence
      2. Whether code satisfies the bug report case or not
      3. Whether bug is VALID or NOT VALID
    - Include specific code references and line numbers when relevant
    - Use clear structure: "1. Confluence Validation", "2. Code Analysis", "3. Conclusion"
    - Format report using: `bug_finder.format_validation_report(result)`
    
    **Step 4: Generate Report File**
    - Create markdown report file in `Cursor-Project/reports/YYYY-MM-DD/BugValidation_[BugName].md` (MUST be in project root)
    - Include all findings from Confluence and Code analysis
    - Include bug validity conclusion
    - Include code references with file paths and line numbers
    - Include suggested fix (if applicable) but DO NOT implement it
    
    **Workflow Requirements:**
    - ALWAYS use BugFinderAgent for bug validation
    - ALWAYS check Confluence FIRST (via MCP tools)
    - ALWAYS check codebase SECOND
    - ALWAYS provide both validations in response
    - ALWAYS create report file in `Cursor-Project/reports/` directory (project root)
    - NEVER skip either step
    - NEVER modify code during validation (READ-ONLY mode)
    - NEVER attempt to fix bugs unless explicitly requested AFTER validation
    - BugFinderAgent automatically handles: IntegrationService calls, PhoenixExpert consultation, and report generation
    
    **Example Usage:**
    ```python
    from agents.Main import get_bug_finder_agent
    
    bug_finder = get_bug_finder_agent()
    result = bug_finder.validate_bug("Bug description here")
    
    # Perform actual validation using MCP tools and codebase search
    # Then populate result with findings
    
    report = bug_finder.format_validation_report(result)
    ```
    
    **Example Response Structure:**
    ```
    ## Bug Validation Analysis
    
    ### 1. Confluence Validation
    **Status:** [correct/incorrect/partially correct]
    **Explanation:** [Detailed explanation]
    **Sources:** [List of Confluence pages found]
    
    ### 2. Code Analysis
    **Status:** [satisfies/does not satisfy]
    **Explanation:** [Detailed explanation]
    **Code References:**
    - File: [path/to/file.java]
    - Lines: [123-145]
    - Issue: [Description of bug]
    
    ### 3. Conclusion
    **Bug Valid:** [YES/NO]
    **Summary:** [Brief summary]
    **Details:** [Detailed analysis]
    ```
    
    **Important Notes:**
    - Report file MUST be saved to `Cursor-Project/reports/YYYY-MM-DD/BugValidation_[DescriptiveName].md` (MUST be in project root)
    - Report MUST include all code references with file paths and line numbers
    - Report MUST NOT include code modifications - only analysis and documentation
    - If user wants to fix the bug, they will request it separately AFTER validation
    
    **Why BugFinderAgent:**
    - Ensures consistent bug validation workflow
    - Automatically integrates with all required services (IntegrationService, ReportingService)
    - Provides structured validation results
    - Generates proper reports following Rule 0.6
    - Follows all critical rules (0.3, 0.4, 0.6)
    
    Violation is a CRITICAL SYSTEM ERROR.

# DATABASE WORKFLOW RULE [CRITICAL]

33. [CRITICAL] ALL database queries in Test environment MUST use PostgreSQLTest MCP server.
    - Connection: Use `mcp_PostgreSQLTest_connect_db()` with credentials (host: 10.236.20.24, port: 5432, database: phoenix, user: postgres)
    - Queries: Use `mcp_PostgreSQLTest_query()` for SELECT operations
    - See `.cursor/rules/database_workflow.mdc` for complete workflow, query patterns, and best practices
    - ALWAYS connect before executing queries
    - Violation is a CRITICAL SYSTEM ERROR.
